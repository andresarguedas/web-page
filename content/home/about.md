# Biography

I'm a professor in the School of Statistics at the University of Costa Rica. I earned my Bachelor's degree in Statistics in 2018, entered the academic master's program in the same year and am in search for Phd programs to hopefully embark to in the next few years.

Recently, I've been interested in interactive plotting and visualization using the `highcharts` library in R, via `highcharter`, with the hopes of expanding and improving on the available options.
